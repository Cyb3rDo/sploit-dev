// Protobuf definition for the salted hash file type.
// This is focused on sending *uncracked* hashes around over the network.  The
// cracked hashes don't need to be sent in bulk to the remote system.  There is
// also a buffer defined for sending the cracked hashes back to the server.
// This sends salted hash/value pairs around as needed, paired with their
// additional data as needed.  By doing this, the base salted class can send
// almost all the possible hash types around without them needing to do any
// overriding of behavior.
